//Create a class called Date that includes: three pieces of information as instance variables â€” a month, a day and a year.

//Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values provided are correct.
// Provide a set and a get for each instance variable.
//
//Provide a method DisplayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes /.
//
//Write a test application named DateTest that demonstrates class Date capabilities.
